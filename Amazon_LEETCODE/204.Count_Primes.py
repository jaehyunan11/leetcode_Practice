# Explanation:
# There are 4 prime numbers less than 10, they are 2, 3, 5, 7.

# Algorithm Sieve of Eratosthenes
# -> input : an integer n > 1
# -> output : all prime numbers from 2 through n.

# Let A be an array of Boolean values, indexed by intergers 2 to n
# initially all set to True

# for i = 2,3,4,....not exceeding squat n do
#   if A[i] is True
#       for j = i2, i2+i, i2+2i, i2+3i... not exceeding n do
#           A[j] := False
# return all i such that A[i] is true


# For ùëõ not to be prime, it needs at least two prime factors.

#   1. Checking till sqrt(n) is enough for prime numbers i.e i*i < n
#   2. mark all as prime.
#   3. as you move along (i to i*i<n) mark every multiple until n as False.
#   4. you donot need start from i for that we can start from i*i i.e j=i*i
